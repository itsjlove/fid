<!--Changed <a href="jenskitchen/index.html"> to <a href="jenskitchen/jenskitchen.html">, because your path was correct, but in your jenskitchen folder the file is named "jenskitchen.html", not "index.html". Two choices, you can leave this as <a href="jenskitchen/index.html"> then rename jenskitchen.html to index.html in the jenskitchen folder, or just change <a href="jenskitchen/index.html"> to <a href="jenskitchen/jenskitchen.html"> in this file --> 
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>Click <a href="glossary.html">here</a> to see the glossary!</p>
<!-- Same change as the "bgnews" change. Your glossary.html is in the same folder as your index.html, so <a href="glossary/glossary.html"> needed to just be <a href="glossary.html"> -->
